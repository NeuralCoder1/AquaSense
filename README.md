# AquaSense
Groundwater is essential for India’s drinking water, agriculture, and industry. Despite supporting 16% of the global population, India has only 4% of freshwater resources. This project uses real-time DWLR data and machine learning to monitor groundwater levels, detect anomalies, and support sustainable, data-driven groundwater management.
